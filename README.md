__NOTE: In order for the driver to work stably, the drivers of Firewall, Secure Boot, Windows Defender and other anti-virus programs must be turned off or even deleted. Delete these software completely.__

- Download the file from the link below and extract its contents to a folder.
- IF YOU DO NOT START the simple_injector_3.2.exe file **AS ADMINISTRATOR** YOU WILL GET AN ERROR!

- **The file is deleted, cannot be opened**

The only solution to this error is to turn off Windows Defender and other security programs.
There is no 3rd party negative content in the Zula Simple Cheat software, but false positives can occur on Zula Simple Cheat, as it can on most cheats.

- **Blue Screen and Error Codes**

These problems are usually seen on new operating systems (Windows 11, Windows 10 20H2+). The extra features in these versions conflict with the modules and functions used in Zula Simple Cheat's infrastructure and may cause problems. Another reason for this is that the Driver does not work in the same direction. Disable modern Windows functions such as Firewall and Secure Boot and try again. If it doesn't work, you will also need to disable the "Windows Virtualization Based Security" function.

- **.NET Framework errors**

You need to run the application as an administrator. You need to download and install modules such as Microsoft Redist and VS SDK on your computer.

- **Inject Failed Error**

Close all 3rd party programs/software and start the cheat again. This includes Zula and Anti-Virus programs.
